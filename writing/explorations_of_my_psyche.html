    <p>I often have difficulty making friends, for various reasons. Consider these as stages:<br>
        1) Similar interests: My interests are often very esoteric and scattered, and if my friends' interests do not have a sufficient overlap I tend to distance myself.<br>
        2) Once you have become someone who I cherish, I want to build palaces for you. I want to craft elaborate labyrinths and adventures for you to embark on. It galls me to give trivial gifts.<br>
